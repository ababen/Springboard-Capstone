# Springboard-Capstone
1. What is the problem you want to solve?<br />
2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis. That they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?<br />
4. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?<br />
5. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).<br />
6. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.<br />

# Ideas
* Create list of all words which need to be standardized.
* Figure out how to apply the dictionaries which already exist.
* Is there a list of twitter/internet jargon which can be converted to dictionary text?
* Figure out if I can get the Google Jigsaw (http://www.refinery29.com/2016/09/122793/google-jigsaw-isis)

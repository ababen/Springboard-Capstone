# Springboard-Capstone
1. What is the problem you want to solve?<br />
2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis. That they wouldn’t have otherwise?<br />
4. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?<br />
5. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).<br />
6. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.<br />
<br />

# Ideas
* Create list of all words which need to be standardized.
* Figure out how to apply the dictionaries which already exist.
* Is there a list of twitter/internet jargon which can be converted to dictionary text?
* Figure out if I can get the Google Jigsaw (http://www.refinery29.com/2016/09/122793/google-jigsaw-isis)
* What can I learn from ISIS #hashtag campaigns?

# Directions from Instructor<br />

Here is how we will proceed with your project. Treat this as a pseudo code.<br />
<br />
1. Read the sentiment.csv file - Chapter 2 should help you here.<br />
2. Correct typos, replace some words<br />
3. Remove stopwords i.e. words that don't add any value<br />
4. Convert the data to a document matrix<br />
5. plot the data<br />
<br />
sparse matrix<br />
stopwords<br />
